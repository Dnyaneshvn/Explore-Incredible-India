    <p style="font-size: 24px;"><i> Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent.
            Given the
            diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use
            locally
            available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.
            <br>
            <br>
            Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and
            traditions.
            Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe was
            the
            primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery. Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia.
            Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Europe (especially
            Britain), the
            Middle East, Southern African, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North America, Mauritius, Fiji, Oceania, and the
            Caribbean</i>
